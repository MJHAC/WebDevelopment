                Hi, this is your friendly coder — someone who’s trying hard to upgrade himself.
                I've lost many times, but I'm still pushing forward to become stronger.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                At first, I thought life was simple. But after seeing the real world, I realized it's vast.
                I'm now committed to advancing through coding and studies, building a better version of myself.
